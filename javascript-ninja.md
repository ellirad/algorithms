Understanding the browser

Events—A huge majority of JavaScript applications are event-driven applica-
tions, meaning that most of the code is executed in the context of a response
to a particular event. Examples of events include network events, timers, and
user-generated events such as clicks, mouse moves, keyboard presses, and so
on. 

Browser API—To help us interact with the world, the browser offers an API that
allows us to access information about devices, store data locally, or communicate
with remote servers.
